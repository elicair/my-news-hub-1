<head> <b>Fire takes Brown's house!</b></head> 

<p> A fire started by a faulty electrical breaker destroyed the Browns home.  A donation has been started and all are encouraged to contribute. The Browns are currently renting a home until an insurance claim is filed however due to the swiftness of the fire much of their clothing and cooking utensils were lost along with one of the cars which remained trapped in the garage.</p>


<p> local investigators have narrowed down the cause of the fire to a breaker in an adjacent out building. The ageing breaker failed which caused a small string of sparks to land in nearby garden waste. The sparks quickly ignited the dried plants which smoldered until the surrounding wooden box caught fire. The fire quickly engulfed the out building and spread to the main house. Although fire fighters were on the scene in record time there was no saving the home as much of it had already begun to burn in the 10 mph wind.</p>

<p> according to fire weekly <blockquote> The fire that took the browns family home is becoming far too common among aging homes. The electrical systems weren't meant to last as long as they have which leads to more and more fires.</blockquote></p>
